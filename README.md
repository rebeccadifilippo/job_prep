# Job Prep Repository 🚀

This repository is a structured workspace for preparing for **software engineering** roles.

The goal of this folder is to build both:

* **Problem-solving fluency** for coding interviews
* **Conceptual + implementation skills** for AI/ML interviews

## 🧠 Leet Folder

The `leet/` directory is organized by common algorithm patterns used in technical interviews. This guide was created by a coder named neet and its called "neetcode 150".

---

## 🤖 AI Folder

The `ai/` directory contains implementations of foundational neural network architectures and experiments.
These files are intended to support interview preparation by demonstrating understanding of machine learning concepts and the ability to implement models in code.
